/*
In This code we learned that we can do everything inside an object, i.e:
add,edit,remove its properties,methods
even if we use const or any other declaration method, 
this happens because the object isnt used as a value,
but it is assigned a location in memory which is then referenced to further usage,
thats why further usage alters the original object
