Introduction:
 Databases play a crucial role in storing and managing data.
 SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for interacting with databases.
 In this presentation, we'll explore essential SQL commands: DDL, DQL, DML, DCL, and TCL.

Data Definition Language (DDL):
 DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define and manage the structure of the database.
 Examples of DDL commands:
   CREATE: Define a new table.
   ALTER: Modify existing table structure.
   DROP: Delete a table.
 Let's see an example of creating a "Users" table:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
  );
  ```

Data Query Language (DQL):
 DQL (Data Query Language) is used to retrieve data from the database.
 The primary DQL command is SELECT.
 Basic syntax of SELECT statement:

  ```
  SELECT columns
  FROM table
  WHERE condition;
  ```

 Example of retrieving user names from the "Users" table:

  ```
  SELECT name
  FROM Users
  WHERE id > 10;
  ```

Data Manipulation Language (DML):
 DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to manipulate data within the database.
 Examples of DML commands:
   INSERT: Add new records.
   UPDATE: Modify existing records.
   DELETE: Remove records.
 Let's update a user's email in the "Users" table:

  ```
  UPDATE Users
  SET email = 'newemail@example.com'
  WHERE id = 15;
  ```

Data Control Language (DCL):
 DCL (Data Control Language) is used to manage permissions and access rights.
 Examples of DCL commands:
   GRANT: Provide permissions.
   REVOKE: Remove permissions.
 Granting SELECT access to a user on the "Users" table:

  ```
  GRANT SELECT ON Users TO username;
  ```

Transaction Control Language (TCL):
 TCL (Transaction Control Language) is used to manage database transactions.
 Examples of TCL commands:
   COMMIT: Save changes.
   ROLLBACK: Undo changes.
   SAVEPOINT: Set points within transactions.
 Committing a transaction:

  ```
  BEGIN;
   SQL operations
  COMMIT;
  ```

Summary:
 DDL defines database structure.
 DQL retrieves data.
 DML manipulates data.
 DCL controls permissions.
 TCL manages transactions.
 Understanding these commands is essential for effective database management.

Conclusion:
 Properly using SQL commands ensures accurate and secure data management.
 Further learning and practice will enhance your database skills.
